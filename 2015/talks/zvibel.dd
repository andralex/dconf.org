ABSTRACT =
The talk will discuss using D for a large scale distributed project implementing a primary storage system with strict performance and resources requirements. Will go over the pros and cons of using D and compare our experience to previous similar projects implemented in C and C++ with Python.

$(P We are an experienced group of system programmers, implementing a large software based storage system. We have leveraged D specific features to make sure we have a very sound infrastructure to use, some of the things we did were previously either impossible or impractical using only C or C++ forcing us to use Python for code generation, on the other hand$(MDASH)some D aspects make it more difficult to handle than the other options. I will present what we really like, and what weâ€™ve learned to live with.)
