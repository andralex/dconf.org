ABSTRACT = This talk highlights why D is so appealing to long-time C++ folks. Whilst D is much more than just a better C++, that’s just how I use it. Not only does it do C++-like things in a more friendly and powerful way, but it adds modern language and library features found in other languages (Python, C#, Java, Haskell) in a familiar, easy-to-learn/use syntax.

BIO =
Chuck Allison was an early member of the ISO C++ Standards committee (1991–2001) and designed and provided the reference implementation for std::bitset. He was a columnist and editor for the C/C++ Users Journal (1992–2003), and wrote two books on C++: C & C++ Code Capsules (1998) and Thinking in C++, Volume 2, with Bruce Eckel (2004), both published by Prentice-Hall. After twenty years of developing software he returned in 2001 to his first professional love, teaching. He is a professor and chair of computer science at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. He has published over 100 articles and in his spare time gives training on C++, Python, D and software development principles. Except when he is playing his classical guitar or bicycling the backroads of central Utah, that is. He was an early adopter of D and has never missed a DConf.
